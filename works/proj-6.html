		<p>This is a concept for a new cocktail space: <em>No Such Place</em>. The bar is a 50s style bar, an art gallery and a business travel lounge.
		I was inspired by emblems of the aviation and I used colours of the US vintage flag to give a vintage touch.
		I used a martiniâ€™s glass shape as the focal point in the letter <strong>A</strong> to symbolize the lounge cocktail bar nature of this space.</p>
